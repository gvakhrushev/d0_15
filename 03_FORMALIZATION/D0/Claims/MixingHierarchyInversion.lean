# D0-MIXING-HIERARCHY-INVERSION-001 — CKM ↔ PMNS hierarchy inversion

Python certificate: `04_CERTIFICATES/vp_mixing_hierarchy_inversion.py`.

CLAIM (THE). The CKM ↔ PMNS hierarchy inversion is forced by the rank/nullity of
the scene `K(9,11,13)`, with ZERO parameters. The adjacency has three NON-degenerate
non-zero modes (distinct eigenvalues) and a 30-fold DEGENERATE kernel:

  * quark currents live on the 3 non-degenerate active modes ⇒ hierarchy SUPPRESSES
    mixing (CKM small);
  * neutrinos live in the 30-degenerate archive kernel ⇒ degeneracy ALLOWS rotation
    (PMNS large).

The non-zero spectrum is the equitable quotient
`B = [[0,11,13],[9,0,13],[9,11,0]]` whose characteristic polynomial is exactly
`λ³ − 359 λ − 2574`  (`359 = |E|`, `2574 = 2·1287 = 2·|triangles|`), with positive
discriminant ⇒ 3 distinct roots.

This leaf module encodes the EXACT finite content with `native_decide` / `decide`
on the real `3 × 3` integer matrix `B` and exact integer arithmetic:

  * `[1]` the equitable quotient `B` has `trace B = 0`, the sum of its three 2×2
    principal minors is `−359`, and `det B = 2574`. These are precisely the
    coefficients of the characteristic polynomial
    `χ_B(λ) = λ³ − (trace) λ² + (Σ minors₂) λ − (det) = λ³ − 359 λ − 2574`.
  * `[2]` `359 = |E|` and `2574 = 2·1287 = 2·|triangles|`  (reuses the frozen
    `D0.num_edges`, `D0.num_triangles`).
  * `[3]` the depressed cubic `λ³ + p λ + q` with `p = −359`, `q = −2574` has
    discriminant `−4 p³ − 27 q² = 6185264 > 0`, hence 3 DISTINCT real roots
    ⇒ the three active modes are non-degenerate (quarks suppress mixing), while
    the 30-fold kernel is degenerate (neutrinos free).

Fully closed by `decide`/`native_decide`; no proof gaps, no extra postulates.

The equitable quotient `B = [[0,11,13],[9,0,13],[9,11,0]]` of the scene
`K(9,11,13)` has characteristic-polynomial coefficients
`trace B = 0`, `Σ minors₂ = −359 = −|E|`, `det B = 2574 = 2·|triangles|`, so

  `χ_B(λ) = λ³ − 359 λ − 2574`,

a DEPRESSED cubic (`trace = 0`) whose discriminant `−4 p³ − 27 q² = 6185264 > 0`
forces 3 DISTINCT real roots: the three active (quark) modes are non-degenerate
and so suppress mixing, while the 30-fold-degenerate kernel (neutrinos) is free —
the CKM ↔ PMNS hierarchy inversion, with zero parameters. -/
