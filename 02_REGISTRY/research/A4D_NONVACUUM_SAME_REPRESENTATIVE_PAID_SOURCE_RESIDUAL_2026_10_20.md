# Same nonvacuum Brinkmann representative: exact paid-port residual and its CAR-parity location

20 October 2026. Existing scientific Draft #334 / EXP-A4D-JOINT-RESPONSE-DECOUPLING-MICROSTRUCTURE; `native-programme-v1`, consumer `constitutive` -> `native_sector` -> `gr_operational_realization`. Scientific inputs frozen at `313923d2dad60bff4038d8f4414528c9f3e5ad7a`; main input `0bf309b6260cf5b63e54d6ccabdcdae6734b950a`.

**Result:** the actual known two-round port-cost source is evaluated on the exact nonvacuum J2 Brinkmann fields, with the corrected coframe/link map and the full normalized scalar/top/clock section. Its explicit coherent counting-site lift has a nonzero *material* Euler residual. All 16 coframe and 24 independent Lorentz directions on one free transverse column, and the two material rows, are computed without freezing the Julia roots, the second round, or normalization. A separate analytic theorem explains the leading residual at every mesh and every finite port horizon: the null scalar/top perturbation is even, the vacuum clock section is odd, and the positive native Dirac operator is odd. The mixed material/geometry Hessian vanishes while the material Hessian is positive. Thus a connection-only Schur correction cannot remove this particular source in the known port-plus-independent-geometric component model.

This is NOT an identification of port cost with complete Book03 Cost-Info. The coherent site lift is an explicit conditional comparison map, not a derived compulsory G0 preparation or the old full-rank128 Riesz branch. No new selected action, source cancellation, gauge constraint, independent acceptance, or GR closure is asserted.

## 1. Existing results composed, not repeated

| Owned input | Exact use here |
|---|---|
| `D0_GR_PRIMARY_POSITIVE_CASE.md` and the original `arbitrary_brinkmann_all40.md` | Supply the actual configured 16+24+2 zero-source family, the advanced Cartan link and the null scalar/top source; no new search for Einstein solutions |
| `check_exact_null_marked_curvature_readout.py` at 313923d2 | The same positive null-dual probe reads Ricci and Weyl separately on the chosen finite representative |
| `A4D_COMPLETE_RECORD_CHANNEL_AND_NATIVE_COST_SOURCE.md` §§1-5 | Supplies the actual 128-outcome channel, its paired Julia recycling, port code and flat energy conservation |
| `A4D_SAME_HISTORY_PRICE_AND_SOURCE_COMPOSITION_2026_10_20.md` §§1-4,7 | Supplies the exact paid-history source, real clock bookkeeping and corrected map `e_N=nu^-1 S e_J2`, `U_N=S U_J2 S^-1` |
| Its full24 stationary connection calculation | Is retained at its protected8 Fourier input, not falsely transplanted to this scalar/top preparation. The parity theorem below determines whether connection relaxation can supply the missing material source |

The difference from the previous protected8 sine-profile test is substantive: the new fields are already a configured **nonvacuum Einstein solution**, and the preparation is the actual four-grade scalar/top/clock section of that positive case, not an excited protected8 eigenshell. The comparison remains conditional on its explicitly stated site lift.

## 2. One finite representative and its preparation map

Use the original null basis with eta_(+-)=eta_(-+)=1, eta_xx=eta_yy=-1. Let k=2*pi and sigma>0 be small. On h=1/L, define

    lambda = lambda_-(2^-20),
    E = k^2 sigma^2,
    H(x,y) = -lambda E (x^2+y^2) + A_W (x^2-y^2),
    r_h = kh / (2 sin(kh/2)),
    Psi_j^h = sigma r_h (cos(k u_j), sin(k u_j)).                  (1)

This is an actual midpoint history: `Psi_(j+1)^h-Psi_j^h = h Psi'(u_j+h/2)` for the fixed continuum field `Psi(u)=sigma(cos ku,sin ku)`. Its finite norm is constant and its genuine difference energy is EXACTLY E for every h. The transverse five-point Laplacian gives `Delta_perp,h H = -4 lambda E`; the quadratic Weyl term is exactly discrete harmonic. The owned all40+2 reduction therefore makes every free interior configured J2 Euler row zero. Use periodic u/v as a mathematical regulator and a fixed transverse collar; no periodic physical causal time is claimed.

The true advanced Cartan link has

    K_x(z) = [H(z+u)-H(z+u-x)]/2,
    K_y(z) = [H(z+u)-H(z+u-y)]/2.

Here H is u independent, so the advance is literal but numerically unchanged. Set `S=diag(1,1,-1,-1)`, `nu=3/5`. The native positive-spatial creator legs and proper links are

    V_u=nu e_-, V_v=nu(e_+-H e_-/2), V_x=nu e_x, V_y=nu e_y,
    U_u=exp(-K_x N_2-K_y N_3), U_v=U_x=U_y=I.                    (2)

The minus sign in (2) is the corrected physical coframe map, not the earlier mislabeled LC sign. The observer `n=(1,1,0,0)/sqrt(2)` gives its positive Gram I in this null basis. The proper exterior lift of S fixes all four masks 1,0,15,14 used in the original material section.

Retain that complete normalized section:

    m_j=sqrt(p)|1> + psi_0,j|0> + psi_4,j|15>
        +sqrt(p^2-|Psi_j|^2)|14>,       p+p^2=1.                 (3)

The explicitly supplied comparison lift is

    Omega_h = L^-2 sum_(u,v,x,y) |u,v,x,y> tensor m_j.            (4)

It has norm one on the full `L^4 x CAR16` data carrier. This is a **coherent counting-site lift**. It is not an assertion that the actual unequal Golden LEFT/AF preparation or full fixed-Gram reference128 purification is already (4). The known channel tensors identity on an arbitrary untouched oldRIGHT; a selected correlated full128 preparation still needs its actual map. Neither pure-state normalization nor a spectator reference supplies that missing physical admission.

For this static geometry, all native Kraus operators and the source directions used below preserve u/v translation. The input (4) has u Fourier modes 0,+1,-1 and v mode0. The cost effect is block diagonal in those modes. Computing its trace from three blocks is therefore an **exact contraction** on the full carrier, not deletion of unoccupied modes, thermal modes, cross-mode memory, or failure records. The full state remains coherent; this argument concerns the stated prepared observable and its variation only.

## 3. Exact full two-round paid-source operator

Use the original definitions with the actual shifted positive adjoint:

    C_r=C(V_r), P_r=C_r Lambda(U_r) shift_r,
    D=h^-1 sum_r(P_r-C_r) + adjoint,
    Delta=D^2, epsilon=p^2 h^2/64.

The original paired recycling map is `T(X)=(1/16) sum_(i=1)^32 W_i X W_i*`, with, for each role, `W=(P,P*,sqrt(I-PP*),sqrt(I-P*P),C,C*,sqrt(I-CC*),sqrt(I-C*C))`. The paired list is also self-adjoint as a superoperator. Every actual native label/coefficient/port is retained.

The already-derived price identity becomes the exact finite operator

    E C_port,2 = 2 + <Omega, H_2 Omega>,
    H_2 = 2p epsilon Delta
          + p epsilon^2 [D T(Delta) D-Delta^2].                 (5)

There is NO truncation in native time in (5). It is the full two-round expectation, including all 128^2 ordered outcomes, via the proven channel contraction. The number 2 is the paid baseline, not a field source at fixed clock. Two native port rounds are not silently identified with two configured scene-J2 steps.

At fixed fields, the complete preparation source is

    d C_port,2 = 2 Re <dOmega,H_2 Omega>.                        (6)

For a real matter variation, the last amplitude of (3) changes:

    d m_14 = -(psi_0 dpsi_0+psi_4 dpsi_4)/sqrt(p^2-|Psi|^2).     (7)

Thus the full material covector contains the subtraction from the actual grade14 component; a frozen normalization is not used. Field sources differentiate D and every W. The positive-root derivative is computed by its Sylvester equation `R dR+dR R=d(R^2)` on a verified strict positive chart. No square root, recycling term, or second-round preparation response is frozen.

## 4. Actual nonvacuum evaluation: explicit internal residual, not another spectrum catalogue

The default replay uses L=10, sigma=1/100, A_W=3/100, nu=3/5. Its full carrier has 10,000 sites and all16 CAR grades. The smallest tested Julia-defect eigenvalue is >0.6372. All configured interior geometric/matter residuals vanish by the exact original theorem; the replay's reduced-stencil error is below 2e-15.

The same two fixed null-dual probes are transported with S together with the plaquettes. At probe strength 1/4 the two actual positive marks are

    m_x=0.3818491007992323, m_y=0.38190638577041647,

and invert to

    a_ux=-0.0012244426845455791,
    a_uy=-0.0006244426845434248,
    Ric_uu=0.18488853690890036, A_W=0.03000000000010771.          (8)

The actual two-round port calculation gives

    R=<Omega,Delta Omega>=0.0020502578011074154,
    Gamma=<Omega,[D T(Delta)D-Delta^2]Omega>
         =-2.6310969212725577e-7,
    E C_port,2=2.000000151250066.                               (9)

Gamma need not have the sign of the old protected8 calculation: its preparation and physical family are now different. Both terms in (9) are retained.

Take a compactly supported transverse material tangent at the central free column:

    dPsi_j = chi(x,y) Psi_j,   chi=1 only at the central x/y site,

with (7), fixed geometry and unchanged original clock amplitude sqrt(p). It is a real normalized variation, not a change of the initial-state norm or the outer boundary. Then

    D_chi E C_port,2 = 2.0969052019918353e-9,
    D_chi E C_port,2 / (2p epsilon) = 2.842442552963308e-5.      (10)

An independent central finite difference on the normalized preparation curve gives `2.0969052021472137e-9`. All configured scalar/top Euler rows are zero on the same fields: `q=0` and their full first variation is killed by the genuine v-Stokes identity, not by varying only an ansatz. The existing Palatini term has no material dependence. Therefore (10) is an explicit residual against **any scalar multiple** of their zero material covector, under map (4).

The receipt also contains all 16 native-leg and 24 independent proper-link covectors on that free transverse column. These are genuine variations constant in u/v, NOT a claim to have computed every unsymmetrized site row of the full four-dimensional Jacobian. The two material Euler components are reconstructed on every u/transverse site, with their complete normalization correction. Their contraction exactly reproduces (10). Changing the far fixed collar changes (10) by zero at displayed precision.

These decimal values are an author numerical replay, **not** an independently accepted interval enclosure. The next section supplies a separate exact structural statement and a nonzero small-amplitude conclusion without inferring a theorem merely from floating-point sign.

## 5. Exact all-mesh material coefficient and why the existing connection Schur cannot screen it

For the analytic small-amplitude family set `A_W(sigma)=300 sigma^2`. This contains (8)-(10) at sigma=.01 and tends to the native flat background. At sigma=0,

    m_0=sqrt(p)|1>+p|14>        (odd CAR parity),
    d m/dsigma = r_h[cos(ku)|0>+sin(ku)|15>] (even parity),
    D_0 m_0=0,
    Delta_0(k)=4nu^2 h^-2 sin^2(kh/2) I16.                     (11)

The forward difference and the forced r_h factor give, exactly,

    ||D_0 (dOmega/dsigma)||^2 = nu^2 k^2                       (12)

on every mesh. The flat original full128 channel conserves this Delta energy; its full n-round paid excess operator is `n p epsilon Delta_0`.

**Theorem.** For every finite integer n and every permitted h on this explicit smooth field/preparation family,

    (d^2/dsigma^2) E C_port,n |_(sigma=0)
       = 2 n p epsilon_h nu^2 k^2 > 0.                        (13)

Proof: H and the true links first change at order sigma^2, while the even material amplitudes first change at order sigma. The initial odd clock is dark. For the known positive port observable, the cost of changing only that dark state’s geometry by O(sigma^2) is O(sigma^4): every nonzero-port amplitude is O(sigma^2). Its contribution to the second variation is zero. The normalized baseline n stays constant. The remaining quadratic coefficient is exactly `n p epsilon ||D_0 dOmega||^2`, by the already-owned flat energy conservation. Equation (12) finishes the proof. This is a finite-history statement, not a continuum assumption.

**Connection and coframe mixing.** At the same flat seed, every proper-Lorentz exterior action preserves CAR parity, and the actual creator-minus-shift Dirac operator, with its positive adjoint, is odd. Thus any independent coframe/link/observer variation has odd `dD`. Since m_0 is odd, `(dD)m_0` is even, whereas `D_0 dOmega_material` is odd. Consequently

    H_(material,geometry) = 0                                 (14)

for this port-cost Hessian, including all24 connection components. The finite-history quadratic identity can also be seen from the native Kraus words: the base is dark, and at first order the even and odd amplitudes in every paid branch remain orthogonal. The original recycling has `T_0(Delta_0)=Delta_0`; hence its energy-production correction has no total-degree-two term at a dark background.

Additional internal *even* preparation directions which do not change the prescribed scalar/top amplitudes are orthogonal to the material wave. Because Delta_0 is scalar on that Fourier sector, their quadratic energy cross term also vanishes. Odd preparation directions can couple to geometry, but not to this even material block. Thus, on any regular stationary quotient of these internal directions, Schur elimination of the **known port component plus an independent purely geometric Palatini form** leaves the coefficient (13) intact. This is not a theorem about a yet-unspecified full Book Info, whose mixed material source may differ. A constraint changing the admitted material variation must be proved from the physical programme.

This is the useful composition with the earlier full24 result: solving its geometric sourced block is valuable, but cannot by itself supply the missing massless scalar/top equation on this family. No new rank census is needed to decide that question.

If a chosen native positive clock satisfies `beta_h=n_h epsilon_h -> beta>0`, the exact Hessian values obey

    lim_h d_sigma^2 E C_port,n_h(0) = 2p beta nu^2 k^2 > 0.     (15)

Only this exact linearized coefficient is transported. No uniform finite-amplitude expansion, source-to-solution inverse, relation to scene ticks, or nonlinear GR refinement is inferred. In contrast, the configured J2 action has f=q=0 on the complete solution family and zero material Euler there.

## 6. The two new advances now meet in one quantitative equation

For the compact relative-amplitude tangent of (10), the leading small-sigma source is

    D_chi C_port,n/(n p epsilon)
       = 2 nu^2 k^2 sigma^2 mean(chi) + O_h,n(sigma^4)
       = -nu^2 Ric_uu/lambda * mean(chi) + O_h,n(sigma^4).      (16)

The order statement uses the fixed Golden parity-covariant channel and the specified family; its remainder is not asserted uniform at growing n. The Ricci in (16) is recovered from the **same actual two positive null probes** in (8). No Newton coefficient, free source scale or fitted stress was inserted. At the replay point, the leading right side is `2.8424460675141278e-5`, while the complete finite two-round left side is the value in (10). Weyl is independently measured but does not supply a compensating leading scalar source.

Equation (16) is a comparison of a measurable curvature with an explicitly paid residual, NOT an assertion that Fisher information, port cost or measured curvature is the mandatory action. The h^4 single-probe information budget remains the original observation theorem's independent sampling statement.

## 7. Exact missing substitution, rather than an invented repair

Write only as a bookkeeping split of an ACTUALLY derived complete action

    S_full = C_port + C_remaining - I_actual.

The remaining terms include real labels, preparation, reference, observer, controller, clock and work. No term is defined by subtracting the answer. If that action is to have the same first source as the configured Einstein-scalar family under (2)-(4), then on the tested material tangent it necessarily satisfies

    D_chi(C_remaining-I_actual) = -D_chi C_port.                (17)

On a common stationary internal section retaining the physical material field, the corresponding null-sector second source must cancel (13), or a proved equation/observation transport must explain why the physical tangent or preparation differs. The actual source/normalizer/preparation jets, not an arbitrary negative term, decide this.

The task has therefore been reduced from 'compare two impressive constructions' to a specific same-representative conditional source equation with a nonzero computed operand and an exact parity explanation. The next executable scientific step is to derive `D(C_remaining-I_actual)` from the real signed Book/Golden record on the same scalar/top sector, or prove a different native preparation/clock interpretation. It is not another construction of a nonflat metric, an extra scalar curvature invariant, or a re-fit of the geometric coefficient.

**Remaining scope boundaries:** coherent counting-site map (4) is supplied, not physically forced; complete fixedRIGHT128 pure preparation is not selected by this calculation; native port rounds and scene-J2 ticks are different unless a clock map is proved; the complete Book action is still unknown; the numerical witness is not interval acceptance; no whole-action joint stationary recovery or GR/raw216 closure is claimed. `GR_closed=false`.

## 7a. Apply the complete recorded information to the SAME material source

24 October 2026; input a28019143fe4d302770e5a42df8533f89aa85794.
This is an application to (17), not another choice of detector or a
derivation of compulsory Book Info. It consumes the original full128
blank-word identity, the exact primary preparation (4), and the complete
CQ/Gibbs source identity in
[A4D_PAID_MOMENT_FIELD_WRITER_2026_10_21.md, section14.3a](A4D_PAID_MOMENT_FIELD_WRITER_2026_10_21.md#143a-spatial-heat-complete-cq-information-and-the-actual-recycling-defect).
All statements below are at fixed finite mesh h and positive integer n.
Use the small-amplitude family of section5, including A_W=300 sigma^2,
a strict Julia chart and B=I-alpha_h Delta>0, with
alpha_h=epsilon_h/2=p^2 h^2/128.

### Exact complete-history birth without enumerating the tape

Write xi=partial_sigma Omega|_0. By (11)-(12),

    ||xi||^2 = r_h^2,
    Delta_0 xi = lambda_h xi,
    lambda_h = 4 nu^2 h^-2 sin^2(kh/2) = nu^2 k^2/r_h^2,
    D_0 Omega_0 = 0.

For the ACTUAL chronological fine Kraus words M_omega, the all-blank word
is M_(0^n)=B^n; completeness retains every other word, including zeros.
Put b_h=1-alpha_h lambda_h and

    a_(h,n) = r_h^2 (1-b_h^(2n)) > 0.                         (18)

At the dark flat input every nonblank word annihilates Omega_0.
For omega different from 0^n its output vector therefore has the expansion

    v_omega(sigma) = M_omega(sigma) Omega(sigma)
                  = sigma M_omega(0) xi + O_(h,n)(sigma^2).

The geometry starts changing only at order sigma^2. Completeness gives

    sum_(omega != 0^n) ||M_omega(0)xi||^2
      = <xi,(I-B_0^(2n))xi> = a_(h,n).

Consequently q_(0^n)=1-a_(h,n)sigma^2+O(sigma^3), and the Shannon
entropy of the COMPLETE fine record, in natural logarithms, is

    H_fine(sigma) = -a_(h,n) sigma^2 log(sigma^2)
                   + O_(h,n)(sigma^2).                      (19)

No positive-support assumption is imposed on each individual word.
A word with zero leading vector has probability O(sigma^4) and does
not contribute to the leading logarithm. No reset, coarsening of
labels, or restriction to the occupied input Fourier modes changes
the actual instrument in this argument.

### The actual compact material Euler direction

Use exactly the variation in (10),(16): at the given geometry set
delta_chi Psi=chi(x,y)Psi, with chi supported in the free transverse
interior, and differentiate the grade14 square root as in (7).
The physical coframe, links, clock amplitude and collar stay fixed
in THIS derivative. Then

    delta_chi Omega = sigma chi xi + O(sigma^2).

For a nonblank word the corresponding leading output derivative is
sigma M_omega(0)chi xi. Hence the total leading probability derivative is

    2 Re <xi,(I-B_0^(2n))chi xi>
      = 2 a_(h,n) mean(chi).

This uses B_0 xi=b_h xi and self-adjointness; chi need not commute
with B_0. The mean is the original counting-site mean, the same
normalization as (16). The complete first source is thus

    D_chi H_fine
      = -2 a_(h,n) mean(chi) sigma^2 log(sigma^2)
        + O_(h,n,chi)(sigma^2).                              (20)

For a word with vanishing leading vector, its entropy derivative is
bounded by
2 ||v_omega|| ||delta_chi v_omega|| |log ||v_omega||^2|
=O(sigma^3 |log sigma|)=o(sigma^2).
At exact zeros use the continuous extension of the entropy derivative
along this smooth amplitude curve. Thus (20) does not differentiate
log0 or discard a support birth. Branch-by-branch parity is unnecessary.

### Which information (20) actually computes

Let Theta_n be the complete coherent output of the same Stinespring
execution and Gamma_n its restriction/pinching to the full declared
fine-pointer algebra, retaining conditional DATA and oldRIGHT.
For the supplied pure DATA input (4) and an untouched PRODUCT
oldRIGHT state rho_R, every conditional DATA branch is pure. Exactly,

    S(Gamma_n)-S(Omega_in) = H_fine,
    Omega_in = |Omega><Omega| tensor rho_R.

The oldRIGHT entropy, including its derivative if rho_R moves
independently, cancels on the two sides. This does not identify
the full fixed-Gram pure reference128 lift with (4): its nonlocal
density kernel and Rayleigh source differ even when its local CAR
readouts agree. The owned fixedRIGHT preparation source is preserved.

The pinching here can be restriction to the specified readable
record algebra; it is not an uncharged physical erasure operation.
The entropy of the ENTIRE coherent closed system is instead
preserved by its isometry. Its coherent record subsystem entropy
also need not equal H_fine. Thus internal physical memory and
closedness, as required by Books00-01, do not authorize replacing
one of these entropies by another or identifying any of them
with compulsory Book03 Info.

### Substitute into the existing full-price equation

For the DECLARED fine-CQ information component
I_fine=H_fine/log(phi), equations (16),(20) give

    D_chi(C_port,n-I_fine)
      = [2 a_(h,n) mean(chi)/log(phi)]
          sigma^2 log(sigma^2) + O_(h,n,chi)(sigma^2).          (21)

For nonnegative nonzero chi this is nonzero for all sufficiently
small positive sigma. The exact configured Einstein-CAR material
source is zero there. Equation (17), under this information
interpretation, now has a computed second operand: the actual
remaining ledger would have to satisfy

    D_chi C_remaining
      = -[2 a_(h,n) mean(chi)/log(phi)]
           sigma^2 log(sigma^2) + O_(h,n,chi)(sigma^2).         (22)

The exact requirement is D_chi C_remaining =
D_chi I_fine-D_chi C_port,n; the bounded remainder in (22) must
not be mistaken for a known missing analytic price coefficient.
A fixed finite inventory of real-analytic native charges has an
analytic expected source across this dark seed and cannot supply
the nonzero logarithm in (22). A genuine nonanalytic information
valuation, changing stopping programme or different actual
preparation is not excluded. Their complete source must be derived
from that execution, not assigned from (22).

This also applies the new spatial Gibbs identity82b to its actual
primary input. At fixed h,n, the original full spatial H+J+R,
port cost, energy defect and heat reference are smooth analytic
functions on this strict chart. Since that reference is faithful,

    D(Gamma_n || tau_sp)
      = -H_fine - S(rho_R) - Tr Gamma_n log(tau_sp).

The terms involving the product oldRIGHT cancel with the actual
input entropy as in82b. The material logarithm (21) is retained
in this relative-entropy operand; cancelling the recycling sum,
or bounding the stopped-log/Rayleigh difference, does NOT cancel it.
The spatial source identity therefore does not yet identify the
fine-CQ price with the original spatial master action.

For the separately owned amplitude-Born plus expected-Shannon
Bellman binding, the mean remains C-H_phi and the negative
Bellman root potential is -f_2=C-3H_phi/2=-log_phi(Z_2)/2.
The squared-norm partition pressure -log_phi(Z_2) is twice this
quantity; the literal sum of positive amplitudes is a different
partition and is not used here. Thus (20) also fixes their nonzero
half-entropy source difference on this same preparation.
Those two binding premises and the absolute Book anchor remain
explicit; no likelihood, amplitude pressure or coherent whole-state
information is silently substituted for fine-CQ information.

**Parent route change.** The complete fine-record operand in (17)
has now been evaluated analytically on the SAME primary material
direction for every fixed finite h,n. Its logarithm rules out an
automatic cancellation by the known analytic port price and finite
analytic completion. This removes the proposed fine-CQ shortcut to
source equality, while retaining the exact nonvacuum solution family,
the positive source constructions and all conditional universality
theorems. The remaining application is the actual Book valuation
and its same-initial preparation/constraint map, not another
Einstein witness or another entropy coefficient. No uniform
growing-horizon estimate, compulsory preparation, admitted field
writer, stationary solution, or physical GR/raw216 closure follows.
