# D0-CANONICAL-WITHIN-ZONE-SELECTOR-M1-NOGO-001 (EQUIVARIANT arm, decidable no-go)

Python certificates: `05_CERTS/vp_selector_obstruction_nogo.py` (equivariant core, 25/25),
`05_CERTS/vp_selector_ssb_nogo.py`, `05_CERTS/vp_selector_dynamical_nogo.py`,
`05_CERTS/vp_selector_basepoint_nogo.py`.

**The equivariant sub-claim (this module, theorem-grade).**
Frozen scene `K(9,11,13)`, zones `V₉ ⊔ V₁₁ ⊔ V₁₃`, automorphism group
`Aut(K) = S₉ × S₁₁ × S₁₃` (BOOK_01:1576 orbital theorem; BOOK_04:1399). A **within-zone
labeling** of a zone `Vₙ` is a bijection `Vₙ → Lₙ` onto a fixed label alphabet `|Lₙ| = n`; up to
identifying the alphabet with `Fin n`, the set of labelings is `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)`. `Aut(K)`
restricts on zone `n` to the full symmetric group `Sₙ = Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` acting by
**precomposition** `g • b = b ∘ g⁻¹` (relabel which vertex carries which label). This is the
labeling **torsor**.

An `Aut`-**equivariant** canonical labeling is a section fixed by the whole `Sₙ`-action: a
bijection `b` with `b ∘ g⁻¹ = b` for **every** `g ∈ Sₙ`. This module proves, as a decidable
theorem on the finite structure, that

> **the number of `Sₙ`-fixed labelings is `0` for every `n ≥ 2`** (`1` for `n = 1`, the control).

Hence over `Aut(K) = S₉ × S₁₁ × S₁₃` (product action) the joint equivariant-section count is the
product of the per-zone counts, so it is `0`: **no internal `Aut`-equivariant canonical within-zone
labeling of `K(9,11,13)` exists.** The obstruction to an internal equivariant selector is
non-trivial.

**Proof idea (the invariance wall).** `Sₙ` acts *simply transitively* on `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)`
(the labelings): if `b ∘ g⁻¹ = b` and `b` is a bijection then `g⁻¹ = 1`, i.e. `g = 1`. So a
labeling fixed by *all* of `Sₙ` forces `g = 1` for every `g`, which fails as soon as `Sₙ` has a
non-identity element (`n ≥ 2`). Equivalently: an `Sₙ`-invariant function `Vₙ → Lₙ` is constant on
the single `Sₙ`-orbit of vertices, hence not injective for `n ≥ 2`.

**Honest scope (must stay in the notes).** This module closes ONLY the **equivariant** selector
class (arm X3a). It does NOT close the fully-general "any owned internal rule" case (X3b): the
SSB / dynamical / basepoint mechanisms are non-equivariant by construction and are handled by the
finite Python certificates via the M1 *relocation-of-catalog* test (every inspected mechanism
relocates the catalog; each owned functional is a class function of `Sₙ` so its extrema are
`Sₙ`-fixed or a degenerate `Sₙ`-orbit, never a unique non-symmetric point). X3b is **evidence**
(a completed mechanism sweep + the class-function argument), NOT a single universal impossibility
theorem. Only the equivariant arm is a Lean theorem; this is stated honestly and not over-claimed.

/-- The set of `Sₙ`-**equivariant** within-zone labelings of a zone of size `n`: bijections
`b : Fin n ≃ Fin n` (the labelings) that are fixed by the precomposition action `g • b = b ∘ g⁻¹`
of *every* `g ∈ Sₙ`. `Fintype`/`DecidableEq` on `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` make this a decidable finite
filter, so its cardinality is computable. -/

/-! ### Concrete decidable checks on small `n` (surrogate for the general theorem)

These mirror `selector_obstruction_check.py`: `n = 1` is the control (a section *does* exist, so
the code can see one), `n = 2,3,4` measure the *absence* of an equivariant section. All four use
`native_decide` (compiled evaluation): kernel `decide` cannot reduce the `Fintype (Fin n ≃ Fin n)`
instance (built through embeddings/`Trunc`) in reasonable time even at `n = 1`. Concrete
enumeration is deliberately capped at `n ≤ 4` (`4! = 24` labelings); the zones `n = 9,11,13` are
handled ONLY by the abstract theorem below — nothing in this module evaluates `Perm (Fin n)` as a
`Finset` for `n > 4`. -/

/-- **Control (`n = 1`).** A size-1 zone admits exactly one labeling and it is trivially
equivariant — so the count is `1`. This guards against a vacuous "always reports 0" checker: the
measurement genuinely distinguishes existence from non-existence. -/

/-! ### The general theorem (why the small-`n` checks suffice for `n = 9,11,13`)

The count is `0` for *every* `n ≥ 2`, proved abstractly: a labeling fixed by all of `Sₙ` forces
every `g ∈ Sₙ` to be the identity, impossible once a non-identity permutation exists. -/

/-- A labeling `b` fixed by the whole `Sₙ`-action forces **every** `g ∈ Sₙ` to be the identity.
(`b.trans g⁻¹ = b` with `b` a bijection cancels to `g⁻¹ = 1`, i.e. `g = 1`.) -/

/-- **The equivariant no-go, general form.** For every `n ≥ 2` the set of `Sₙ`-equivariant
within-zone labelings is empty (its cardinality is `0`): a fixed labeling would force the
non-identity permutation that exists at `n ≥ 2` to be the identity. Purely abstract — no
enumeration of `Perm (Fin n)`, so instantiating at `n = 9, 11, 13` is free. -/

`Aut(K) = S₉ × S₁₁ × S₁₃` the joint equivariant-section count is the product of the per-zone
counts. Each per-zone count is `0` (`no_equivariant_section`, verified concretely for the small
surrogates `n = 2,3,4`), so the joint count is `0 · 0 · 0 = 0`: **no internal `Aut`-equivariant
canonical within-zone labeling of `K(9,11,13)` exists.** The `n = 1` control shows the count is a
real measurement of absence (it reports `1` when a section exists). -/
