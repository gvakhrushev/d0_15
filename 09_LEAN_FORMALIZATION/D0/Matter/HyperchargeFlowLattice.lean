# D0-HYPERCHARGE-FLOW-LATTICE-001 — the K(9,11,13) divergence-free current lattice (Lean)

Python certificate: `05_CERTS/vp_hypercharge_graph_flow_owner.py`.

Front P1 carrier: the complete tripartite graph `K(9,11,13)` (zones 9, 11, 13). The space of
**divergence-free** integer edge-currents (Kirchhoff conservation `div(J)(v) = 0` at every vertex)
is the cycle lattice `ker(B)` of the oriented incidence matrix `B`. For a connected graph its
dimension is the **cycle rank** (first Betti number)

  `dim ker(B) = E − V + 1`,

because `rank(B) = V − 1` on a connected graph. Here `V = 33`, `E = 9·11 + 9·13 + 11·13 = 359`, so the
divergence-free current lattice has dimension `359 − 33 + 1 = 327`. That is the finite object closed here.

HONESTY BOUNDARY.
* **CERT-CLOSED here (`D0-HYPERCHARGE-FLOW-LATTICE-001`):** the cycle-rank identity — the
  divergence-free edge-current lattice of `K(9,11,13)` has dimension exactly `327`.
* **CRITICAL honest fact (also encoded):** the one-generation anomaly-free charge space is **2-dimensional**
  (spanned by hypercharge `Y` and `B−L`). `B−L = (q=1/3, u^c=−1/3, d^c=−1/3, ℓ=−1, e^c=1, ν^c=1)` is itself
  anomaly-free (gravitational and cubic `U(1)` sums vanish) with **denominator 3**. Hence neither the
  327-dimensional graph flow NOR anomaly-freedom alone forces the hypercharge denominator `6`. (The `6` is
  closed separately and correctly by the integrality route `D0-SM-HYPERCHARGE-MINIMAL-DENOMINATOR-001`.)
* **Stays PROOF-TARGET (`D0-HYPERCHARGE-GRAPH-FLOW-OWNER-001`):** the flow→Weyl-ledger map `Φ` that would
  pick out the SM hypercharge row from the 327-dimensional current lattice. It is not constructed.

/-! ## The anomaly-free charge space is 2-dimensional; `B−L` has denominator 3.

The honest obstruction: anomaly-freedom does not pin the denominator to `6`. We exhibit a SECOND
anomaly-free row, `B−L`, with denominator `3`. Together with hypercharge `Y` it spans a 2-dim space.

denominator is `3`. -/

`(B−L)_q = 1/3`, `(B−L)_{e^c} = 1`: `c = 1/2` from the quark forces `Y_{e^c} = 1/2 ≠ 1`.) This witnesses

(iii) anomaly-freedom does NOT force denominator `6` — `B−L` is a second anomaly-free row (gravitational
and cubic sums vanish) with denominator `3`, linearly independent of hypercharge `Y`. Therefore the
`327`-dim flow plus anomaly-freedom leave the SM hypercharge row underdetermined; the flow→Weyl-ledger
