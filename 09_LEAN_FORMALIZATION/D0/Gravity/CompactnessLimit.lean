# D0-COMPACTNESS-LIMIT-001 — causal-threshold compactness `C_max = 3/8` (algebra)

Python certificate: `05_CERTS/vp_gravastar_compactness.py`.

External anchor: the horizonless gravastar (Jampolski-Rezzolla, PRD 113 L121502, 2026).
Reading the horizon as D0's capacity-saturated measurement seam, the seam closes at the
causal-threshold compactness. Eliminating the orbit angles from the three closure
conditions (photon `χ₂=θ⋆`, OS junction `2C=sin²χ₂`, cycle `cosθ⋆=4C−1`) gives the master
equation `2C = 8C − 16C²`, i.e. `16C² − 6C = 0`, whose only roots are `C = 0` and
`C = 3/8`.  This module proves that root computation exactly over `ℚ`.

The structural reading `3/8 = rank/|Ω₈|` (rank = 3 spatial transport, `|Ω₈| = 8`) is the
NAMED GAP that keeps the claim at LEM, not THE: the bridge "rank-3 transport = the causal
light-cone on the 3-sphere seam" is postulated, not derived from M1 (see the cert and
T1.4). The algebra below is exact; only that identification is open.

(`3/8 < 1/2`, `3/8 ≠ 1/2`) — the horizonless window is forced below Schwarzschild. -/
