# D0 — Autonomous session report (Iterations 19–20)

## Iteration 20 — math/physics integration: machine-checked M1-cores of the Clay problems

The physics-formalization push and the Clay-math track are **two sides of one coin**: the physics
machinery already proven CORE *is* the object of the BOOK V §24–§30 millennium reformulations; each
Lean theorem gets two passports. **M1 is proof-theoretic rigor, not a D0-axiom** — a complete proof may
not depend on an unprovable input (the ZFC axioms + actual-infinity continuum are postulated, not
proven). So each result is the **constructively-proven core** of the Clay problem, machine-checked,
with the classical postulate-dependence refuted by an M1-reductio — NOT a ZFC-internal Clay proof, NOT
a dismissible "side reformulation".

**Delivered (8 new claims, strength 3629 → 3762, +133; build GREEN 3792 jobs; 0 holes; demotions 0):**
- **Keystone `D0-M1-PREDICATE-001`** — M1 as a reusable proven predicate (`M1Forced` /
  `RequiresExternalCatalogue`), generalizing the proven `StrictSelected` spine; gap-free, no axiom. It
  was the single blocker for 6/8 reformulations.
- **CORE (ripe):** §27 Navier–Stokes (no-cascade + global existence), §21.2 continuum (= LightProfinite
  inverse limit), §26 Yang–Mills cost-quantum (φ⁻²>0, NOT the operator gap), §30 BSD rank=nullity
  passport (NOT the `ord L=rank` equality).
- **BRIDGE (conditional M1-reductio on the keystone, + named ledger ASSUMP):** §28 Hodge
  (non-algebraic ⇒ external catalogue), §29 Riemann (Re=½ = unique M1-forced axis), §24 P vs NP
  (no global potential ⇒ branch-catalogue).
- **Honesty rule enforced:** a §-N claim is CORE only if the theorem's *conclusion* is the §-N
  conclusion; relation-on-carrier ⇒ BRIDGE + named ASSUMP + the "D0-reformulation under M1; NOT the
  Clay/ZFC problem" caveat. Tier-D keystones genuinely absent from the pin are named, not built
  (§26 operator gap, §30 ord-L equality, §25 `Triangulation3`, §21.3.4 Baire κ-uniqueness).

## Iteration 19 — reuse-first formalization + frontier wins

Owner away ~8h. Mandate: continue the full-Lean-formalization push autonomously — the theory lives
in the books, the Lean layer lags, this is technical catch-up. Discipline: verified-closure protocol
(verify-then-promote; full `lake build D0.All` green gate per unit; `d0_score` integrity demotions = 0;
one reviewable commit per verified unit; reuse existing Mathlib; never fake; name every residual).

**Headline.** strength **3449 → 3629 (+180)**; canonical claims **266 → 275 (+9)**; vacuous-`True` stubs
(guard ratchet) **12 → 1**; load-bearing theorems **~855 → ~1230**; proof holes **0** throughout;
integrity demotions **0**; hygiene **100/100**; all guards green; `lake build D0.All` GREEN (3784 jobs).
**One active over-claim** was surfaced by a full re-audit and **corrected**. 14 commits on `master`.

## What was done (this session)

### A. Reuse wave — closed earlier this session (asset-map items 1–4 + Pisot)
1. `69af4da` — `ASSUMP-COMPACT-LIE-KILLING-NEGATIVE` reclassified: Cartan's compactness criterion is
   absent from the pinned Mathlib → legitimate external owner (the asset map's "READY" was optimistic;
   verify-then-promote caught it). D0's operative matrix-rep Yang–Mills positivity stays internal.
2. `c3fddc6` — **D0-GALOIS-PHI-IRRATIONAL-001**: φ irrational ⇒ genuine quadratic Galois ℤ₂ (reuses
   Mathlib `irrational_sqrt_natCast_iff` + `native_decide`). Upgrades the hand ring-involution.
3. `1370dea` — **D0-SCENE-ACTIVE-EIGENVALUES-001**: §04.2 active eigenvalues EXACT = 3/2 ± √10/40;
   the book's old decimal readouts (summed to 2.999997 ≠ 3) were error-corrected.
4. `6164629` — archive-tower profinite made REAL (`inverseLimit_nonempty`), replacing a `:= True`.
5. `9e84541` — **D0-PISOT-CONTRACTION-TIME-ARROW-001**: arrow of time = Pisot contraction (φ>1, |ψ|<1).

### B. Lean-stub hygiene — vacuous-`True` ratchet 12 → 1
- `66d2115` — **11 of 12** grandfathered `: Prop := True` operator-origin / no-go / boundary markers
  CONVERTED to real statements proved by each module's load-bearing siblings (matrix symmetry,
  gauge / non-abelian curvature skew-closure, PSD trace ≥ 0, Kronecker-of-skews-is-symmetric no-go,
  edge scalar-leakage no-go, orthogonal-conjugation skew preservation, internal Hurwitz-dimension
  closure). The `check_no_tautology_proofs` GRANDFATHER ratchet shrank **12 → 1** (the lone survivor is
  a release-status documentation token in `ReleaseStatus.lean`, no math sibling).
- `8d7f5cb` — the one weak conversion with a tractable route (`BianchiResidual`) was strengthened from a
  `:= rfl` def-restatement to the real theorem `bianchiResidual_skew`. Now **10/11** genuinely
  load-bearing; the remaining weak marker (octonion non-associativity in `D0InternalDimensionSelector`)
  reads a hand-set `Bool` flag — genuine non-associativity needs Cayley–Dickson, absent from the pin.
- `66d2115` — `ASSUMP-HST-EXTERNAL` owner identified (was flagged "unclear"): the HST macro bridge
  (BOOK_02 §02.22, BOOK_06 §06.26) is the finite-subgaussian → continuum-Gaussian convex-response/MGF
  comparison. D0 supplies the finite subgaussian archive atom; the continuum Gaussian is the legitimate
  external owner. Ledger justification + `external_source` sharpened.

### C. Honest over-claim correction (found by an 11-agent audit/frontier workflow)
- `e412ca9` — **D0-HULL-001** was registered LEAN_PROVED/CORE-FORMALIZED on the 5 vacuous
  `D0.Topology.TilingHull` theorems (`Prop` fields `:= true` proved by `rfl`). The proof-of-record was
  REPOINTED to the real `D0.Claims.KTheoryGapModule.ktheory_gap_module` (gap labels in ℤ+ℤφ⁻¹ = Sturmian
  frequencies, exactly proved) — the gap-labeling invariant that is the formal heart of the aperiodic
  hull. Aperiodicity / FLC / repetitivity scoped honestly as cert-backed; a genuine Mathlib
  `Delone.DeloneSet ℝ` instance recorded as a theorem-target. Gate-safe (same CORE status → real
  theorem; integrity demotions 0). **This was the only active over-claim** in the corpus (full re-audit:
  1215 theorems classified, 0 holes, ledger 19/19 legitimate external owners).

### D. Frontier wins (genuine new formalization, Mathlib reuse)
- `743aea8` **P1 — D0-ARCHIVE-LIGHTPROFINITE-001**: the archive tower upgraded from the bespoke
  `InverseLimit` subtype to a GENUINE Mathlib categorical object — an `ℕᵒᵖ ⥤ FintypeCat` diagram
  (`Functor.ofOpSequence` + `FintypeCat.homMk`) whose limit in `Profinite` packages as a `LightProfinite`.
  Structural theorems prove the diagram faithfully encodes the tower (successor map = `archiveProjection`;
  bonding maps surjective). No new dependency.
- `6d7465f` **P2 — D0-FORGETTING-CHANNEL-PTP-001**: forgetting/decoherence as the fully depolarizing
  channel `M ↦ (tr M / n)·I`, proved a genuine POSITIVE TRACE-PRESERVING linear map over real matrices
  (`Matrix.PosSemidef`). HONEST SCOPE: full complete positivity (a Mathlib `CompletelyPositiveMap` over
  `CStarMatrix`) is NOT a bounded hand-proof — the audit verifier was over-optimistic (the
  `map_cstarMatrix_nonneg'` obligation quantifies over all `k×k` amplifications, and the trace channel is
  not a *-homomorphism). Recorded as a theorem-target.

### E. Round-2 frontier closures (a route-finding workflow → 4 more reuse wins)
A second 4-agent route-finder found exact pin routes for items first filed research-level/external;
each was hand-built + build-verified at its honest scope:
- `6897ce9` **D0-DELONE-PHI-001** — the φ-quasicrystal carrier `{⌊nφ⌋}` is a genuine `Delone.DeloneSet ℝ`
  (packing 1/2 via Beatty floor strict-monotonicity; covering 2 via `round(x/φ)`).
- `715e3fe` **D0-FIBONACCI-FUSION-RING-001** — `τ⊗τ=1⊕τ` as `N_τ²=N_τ+1` (`N_τ=[[0,1],[1,1]]`), charpoly
  `X²−X−1`. Sharpens the scalar `φ²=φ+1`.
- `715e3fe` **D0-FORGETTING-CHANNEL-CP-001** — any `*`-hom between matrix C*-algebras is a genuine
  `CompletelyPositiveMap` (identity / compression forgetting model).
- `715e3fe` **D0-BRAID-VALENCE-U1-001** — Artin braid group defined; `B(2) ≅ Multiplicative ℤ` (the
  U(1) anchor), nontrivial + finitely-presented + generated.

---

## Honest residuals (named theorem-targets / owner-edges — NOT closed; keystones absent from the pin)
- **π₁(T²)≅ℤ²** — external owner: the keystone π₁(S¹)≅ℤ is absent from the pin (a TODO comment; only the
  covering ℝ→S¹, injective monodromy, and π₁-product splitting exist). D0 also has no topological torus.
- **Braid SU(2)/SU(3) legs** of THE 04.6.M1.gauge — owner-edge: the Burau/Temperley–Lieb/Jones unitary
  representations and the maps `B(n)→SU(2),SU(3)` are absent from the pin. (The U(1)/`B(2)` leg is now
  CLOSED — D0-BRAID-VALENCE-U1-001.)
- **Fibonacci fusion CATEGORY** (object iso + Ostrik uniqueness) — research-level: no
  `FusionCategory`/Grothendieck-ring in the pin. (The fusion RING level is now CLOSED —
  D0-FIBONACCI-FUSION-RING-001; full topological conjugacy stays the Adler–Weiss owner-edge.)
- **Depolarizing-channel complete positivity** — theorem-target: the depolarizing map is not a `*`-hom,
  so it is unreachable via the pin's only CP constructor. (PTP is proved — D0-FORGETTING-CHANNEL-PTP-001;
  the `*`-hom CP case is now CLOSED — D0-FORGETTING-CHANNEL-CP-001.)
- **Delone-derived FLC / aperiodicity** — research-level: the pin has the `DeloneSet` definition only, no
  FLC/Meyer/hull theorems. (The `Delone.DeloneSet ℝ` instance is now CLOSED — D0-DELONE-PHI-001; the
  underlying aperiodicity is already proved number-theoretically via Sturmian + `KTheoryGapModule`.)
- **Smooth/continuum Bianchi**, **GHP-Cauchy limit**, **2¹¹ Fock residue** — remain the existing
  Rieffel–GHP / Dixmier owner-edges; the pin has torsion on `CovariantDerivative` but no curvature/Bianchi.

---

## Integrity statement
0 proof holes (no `sorry`/`admit`/`axiom` anywhere in `D0/`). 0 active over-claims after the D0-HULL-001
correction. All 19 ledger `ASSUMP-*` rows are legitimate external owners with a real citation, a real
D0-side internal anchor, and confirmed genuine absence from the pin (spot-checked: Cartan, Dixmier trace,
Adler–Weiss, Mordell-E8, Hurwitz badly-approximable). No claim was promoted past its honest level; every
external dependency is a cited owner-edge; every residual is named above. Two over-optimistic "ready"
verdicts were caught by verify-then-promote (Cartan absent from pin; CPTP unbounded) and downgraded to
honest external-owner / theorem-target status rather than faked.
